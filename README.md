Hi, I'm Brandon Ramirez 👋
I'm a computer science student who builds software that tries to actually help people.
I care about accessibility, clean architecture, and making tools that are genuinely useful — not just technically interesting.

What I'm Working On
📱 Visual Snow Solace
A free iOS app for people living with Visual Snow Syndrome — a neurological condition that causes persistent visual disturbances and gets very little attention. The app includes guided breathing, audio noise generation, vision therapy exercises, a symptom education gallery, and a private symptom log. Everything stays on device. No accounts, no tracking, completely free.
Built with SwiftUI, AVFoundation, AVAudioEngine, and Core Image.

What Drives Me
I got into computer science because I believe software can genuinely improve people's lives — not just in a broad abstract sense, but in specific, concrete ways for specific people who need it.
A lot of the most impactful software never gets built because the audience is too small or the problem isn't glamorous enough. That's exactly the kind of problem I want to work on. 
I want to make software at a fair price so I can still pay the bills but not make things subscriptions because I can, one time lifetime licenses always.
